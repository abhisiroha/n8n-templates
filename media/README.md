## Ad Campaign Performance Alert

**Monitor ad campaign performance and receive alerts using AI-powered automation.**

### üöÄ What Does This Workflow Do?
- Accepts ad campaign data via webhook trigger
- Splits and embeds campaign details for semantic search
- Stores and queries data in Pinecone vector store
- Uses Cohere for embeddings and OpenAI for analysis
- Maintains context with window memory
- Logs results to Google Sheets

### üõ†Ô∏è Main Features
- **Webhook Trigger:** Start the workflow with a POST request (e.g., from an ad platform)
- **Text Splitter:** Prepares campaign data for embedding
- **Cohere Embeddings:** Converts text to vector format
- **Pinecone Vector Store:** Stores and queries embeddings
- **OpenAI Chat Model:** Analyzes and summarizes campaign context
- **RAG Agent:** Orchestrates retrieval-augmented analysis
- **Google Sheets Logging:** Appends results for tracking

### üîë Required Credentials
- **Cohere API** (for embeddings)
- **Pinecone account** (for vector storage)
- **OpenAI API** (for analysis)
- **Google Sheets account** (for logging)

Set up these credentials in your n8n instance before running the workflow.

### üì• How to Use
1. **Import the Workflow:**
   - In n8n, go to **Import Workflows** and select `ad_campain_alert.json` from this folder.
2. **Configure Credentials:**
   - Assign your API keys/accounts to the relevant nodes (Cohere, Pinecone, OpenAI, Google Sheets).
3. **Trigger the Workflow:**
   - Send a POST request to the webhook endpoint (`/ad_campaign_performance_alert`) with your campaign data payload.
4. **Monitor Results:**
   - Check Google Sheets for logs.
